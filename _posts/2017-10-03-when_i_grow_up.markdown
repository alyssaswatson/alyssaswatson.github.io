From a ridiculously young age, one of the most consistent questions a kid gets asked is "What do you want to be when you grow up?" This question varies as you get older, including questions about where or if you want to go to college, what you want to major in, what internships you are going to pursue for the summer, and the list goes on. 

My answer was always changing when I was growing up. I wanted to be a veterinarian, a marine biologist, a graphic designer, a public health specialist, as well as probably 100 other professions; however, when I got to college it seemed like everyone had a definite idea of what they wanted to be and I was still unsure. 

I found an internship in a field I liked okay, and so I decided thatâ€™s what I was going to do with my life.  I did more internships throughout college in that field, I joined AmeriCorps straight out of college serving in that field, and then I went and got a real job in that field. After a year, I was bored and wanted a new challenge.

I have been building my own little websites and generally messing around with free coding resources for years, and so I decided that learning to be a software developer would be my next challenge. I think you can never be done learning in your life, and I am excited to begin diving into something new. It feels good to be challenged again.
